# DSA Notes

Welcome to my personal Data Structures and Algorithms notes.

These notes focus on **patterns**, **intuition**, and **common mistakes** rather than exhaustive explanations. The goal is to build problem-solving intuition and recognize when to apply specific techniques.

Each section covers:
- When to use the technique
- Core patterns and variations
- Practical tips and pitfalls
- Worked examples

Use these notes as a quick reference and study guide for interview preparation and algorithm practice.
