# DSA Notes (Placeholder)

This section will host my personal Data Structures and Algorithms notes.

For now, this page is a placeholder. The plan is to focus on **patterns**, **intuition**, and **common mistakes** rather than exhaustive explanations, and to organize content into clear topic-based pages.

Potential areas to cover:

- Arrays, strings, and hashing
- Linked lists, stacks, queues
- Trees and graphs
- Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
- Problem patterns and practice notes

As I build this out, I will gradually replace these placeholders with real content and examples.
